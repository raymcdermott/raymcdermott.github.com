After watching an "inspiring talk from Brett Victor":http://vimeo.com/36579366 I have been inspired to find a principal on which to base my future architecture and development.

It is quite simple: the customer owns his data.  All of the time.

I find good examples in "Dropbox":www.dropbox.com and "iCloud":icloud.apple.com

I find bad examples in "Facebook":www.facebook.com, "Google+":plus.google.com and "Twitter":www.twitter.com
